# SNISP Tests

This fork of the Ergo Reference client has tests made to validate SNISPS. Specifically, `src/test/scala/org/ergoplatform/mining`
contains `SNISPSpec.scala` to see how SNISPS can be validated. It uses methods from `ShareProof.scala` and `SNISPGenerator.scala` in order
to mine shares and validate SNISPs.
